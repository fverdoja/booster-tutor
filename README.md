# Booster Tutor

A Discord bot to generate *Magic: the Gathering* (MTG) boosters and sealed pools

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

## Usage

The bot responds to the following commands:

* `!random`: generates a random pack from the whole history of Magic
* `!historic`: generates a random historic pack
* `!standard`: generates a random standard pack
* `!{setcode}`: generates a pack from the indicated set (e.g., `!znr` generates
  a *Zendikar Rising* pack)
* `!{setcode}sealed`: generates 6 packs from the indicated set (e.g.,
  `!znrsealed` generates 6 *Zendikar Rising* packs)
* `!chaossealed`: generates 6 random historic packs
* `!addpack xyz123`: if issued replying to a pack generated by the bot, adds
  that pack to the previously generated
  [sealeddeck.tech](https://sealeddeck.tech) pool with ID `xyz123`
* `!help`: shows usage message

While replying to any command, the bot will mention the user who issued it,
unless the command is followed by a mention, in which case the bot will mention
that user instead. For example, `!znr @user#1234` has the bot mention
*user#1234* (instead of you) in its reply.

## Host your own bot

### Requirements

The bot should works on `python 3.9+`. All dependencies are listed in
`requirements.txt` and should be installed for the bot to run. If you are
interested in running the tests or doing development, you should also install
the dependencies in `requirements-dev.txt`.

### Run the bot

To host your own bot you will need a Discord token and an Imgur client ID. Once
you have procured those for yourself, follow these steps:

* Make a `config.yaml` file (see `config_template.yaml` for help)

* Download MTGJson data by running:

```bash
  python -m boostertutor.utils.mtgjson_downloader
```

For the first run you might want to download JMP decks as well to allow the bot
to be able to generate them. To download JMP decks, add the `--jmp` parameter
to the previous command.

* Run the bot:

```bash
  python -m boostertutor
```

## Under the hood

### Booster data source

All booster data comes from [mtgjson](https://mtgjson.com), an open-source
project that catalogs all MTG cards.

### Color balancing

MTG boosters are not purely random, mathematically speaking. They are generated
by collating together cards from print sheets in specific orders, this is what
is kind of known in the limited world as "print run". How this is performed is
not publicly disclosed by Wizards, but in practice the process generates
boosters which enforce some desirable properties for limited play (like color
balancing and no duplicates).

To try to produce boosters which *feel* similar to real MTG boosters, Booster
Tutor uses what is known as *Reuben's algorithm*.

> *Reuben's algorithm*
>
> First, generate a booster using a pure random algorithm, then check against
> the following rules, and if any of the rules aren't met, generate a new
> booster. Repeat until a booster that conforms to the rules is generated. The
> rules are:
>
> * A pack must never have more than 4 commons of the same color
> * A pack must have at least 1 common card of each color
> * A pack must have at least 1 common creature
> * A pack must never have more than 2 uncommons of the same color
> * A pack must never have repeated cards

To avoid infinite loops in presence of corner cases, Booster Tutor attempts at
balancing packs with *Reuben's algorithm* up to a maximum number of iterations
(default: 100).

Some packs (for example *Mystery Boosters*) are not balanced. Information on
whether a pack should be balanced or not is obtained from the metadata by
[mtgjson](https://mtgjson.com).
